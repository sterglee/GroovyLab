This is the executable file of GroovyLab, that contains:

1. the executable GroovyLab.jar 
2. Windows and Unix scripts for executing GroovLab using
 appropriate JVM options, for some basic platforms
3. the lib folder that contains the whole 
 Groovy distribution binaries plus jlabgroovy specific scientific libraries.
4. "Abbreviations.txt", a text file that defines abbreviations that can be replaced with the F11 key.
The user can define the preferred abbreviations by editing this file.

5. the defaultToolboxes folder can contain toolboxes that are installed automatically on startup

6. libCUDA provides native support for JCUDA libraries for Win64

Thank you, for using GroovyLab!

GroovyLab requires Java 8.

The preferred scripts seems to be:

RunGroovyLabServerJVMLinux64.sh  // Linux 64, MacOS and other Unix like

RunGroovyLabServerJVMWin64bat  // Windows 64
